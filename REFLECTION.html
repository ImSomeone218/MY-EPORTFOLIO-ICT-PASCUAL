<h1 align="center"> Frist Quarter Reflection </h1>
<body align="center" bgcolor="#3B4B28">
In this quarter, I learned quite a lot. I didn't expect to learn all of this<br>
in a such a short period of time. I never thought I would be able to do all of<br>
the activities I did this quarter. And I never thought I would be able to do this<br>
portfolio without any help, I thought this would be such a difficult task, but as <br>
it turns out, ICT isn't too hard after all, though it did take some time for me to<br>
truly understand the subject and lessons, I've understood it quite well already.
