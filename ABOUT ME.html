I don't have a lot of hobbies, but I have one main thing I like to do in my free time and that's playing my guitar. I'm acutally a part of a band as the Rhythm/Lead Guitarist,<br>
and I'm very proud to say that. In last year's Battle of The Bnads at School, we received individual awards and we also won as the Champion! It's still quite shocking to me to think<br>
we palced 3rd in the BoTB in 2023, and now, we placed as the champion, and I am forever greatful for that opportunity that was given to us.I also like to crochet :)
